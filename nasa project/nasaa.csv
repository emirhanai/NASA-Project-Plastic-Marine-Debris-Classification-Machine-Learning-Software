I picked up 22 of them.  They are sold as ""Saturn Missile Batteries"" from 50 - 300 count units. each missile flies up and explodes with a loud ""pop"" after the battery fuze has been lit. They should be banned as I find these plastic remnants all the way up to Leadbetter Point (a far distance from where they have been fired off.)  anything that is plastic that goes airborne and/or not explodes should also be banned. [per Russ Lewis] plus an email sent from Russ Lewis on 8/19/15 following up on fireworks: Thanks and yes those little plastic Saturn missiles do travel long after they have been shot off enmass over the beach and are then found scattered over large areas. Almost all the fireworks shot off along the Long Beach Peninsula are southward from the Oysterville Approach for about 20 miles to Beards Hollow where the cliffs pinch finally off the beach. There is no legal access north of that approach. These missiles later do eventually migrate northward on up to Leadbetter Point on the currents and the storms and can be routinely found during the middle of Winter on wracklines way up there.   I once did a survey for these missiles by starting at Leadbetter and going south to Beards Hollow where every mile I would do a 100 foot transect water to dune. I think about 24 miles were covered, thus 24 transects. Every transect had these plastic missiles which I separately bagged in a sandwich bag. I mounted each bag on a big piece of plywood with a pasted  map of the peninsula showing the location of each transect. Some transects had 50+ missiles on down to a few up at Leadbetter. Grass Roots still has the demo-board I believe.   Somehow there should be a ban on these specific mini-fireworks polluters being sold to the public. I picked up quite a few spent 300 shot Saturn missile batteries off the beach on the 5th of July, (and later too). Every year these is a new batch of these little plastic objects raining down on the beach to eventually go far and wide into the environment."
